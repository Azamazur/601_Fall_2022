## Read In & Join

I'm working with three surveys for software clients that have some overlap in organizations, respondents, and questions. I anonymized the client email addresses by replacing them with a new variable, `UserID`, the letter of which is indexed to a particular client, and respondents are numbered 1-3 (i.e. R1, R2, R3 are three different people from the same organization). This should allow me to consider responses from different people at the same client organization. 

All three surveys aim to measure client feedback on a single product, and since there are very few repeat respondents, I decided to use `full_join`. This will allow analysis of as much data as possible, while requiring careful handling of NA values. Since two surveys ask respondents to rate responses on a scale of 1-5 and the other on a scale of 1-10, I will divide numeric responses in the third survey by two upon readin.

```{r}
#| label: read-in and joining
#| warning: false
mydivide <- function(x){x/2}
# read in each sheet--is there a way to do this in one step?
survey1_orig <- read_xlsx("_data/ClientSurveys.xlsx", sheet =1)
survey2_orig <- read_xlsx("_data/ClientSurveys.xlsx", sheet =2) %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("How would"), funs(mydivide)),
            .keep = "unused")
survey3_orig <- read_xlsx("_data/ClientSurveys.xlsx", sheet =3) %>%
    mutate(across(starts_with(c("How", "Overall")), funs(mydivide)),
            .keep = "unused")

# full join to keep all data, key = UserID
joinedsurveys_orig <- survey2_orig %>%
  full_join(x = survey2_orig, y=survey1_orig, by = "UserID") %>%
  full_join(survey3_orig, by = "UserID")

```
## Cleaning

As with most surveys, the questions are too long for column names, so I will rename each with the simplest phrasing possible. The new names will also contain prefixes and suffixes that will help with sorting later. The code below includes the full text of each question as it was read in, followed by the new name.

With these new names, I will reorder the columns to that similar data is adjacent. For instance, timestamps for the three surveys are gathered and I remove two columns I don't need (shirt size and address for client gift). I also remove the row with "test" answers.

I want UserID at the front and then alphabetically ordered columns, with numeric variables coming before character variables. I could try to write a function that mutates the fundraising goal and audience variable into 2 variables.

:::{.callout-question}
Is there a more elegant way to make these changes? I couldn't get them all into a single pipe, since some of the operations seem to work in opposing directions (if that makes sense).

deduped_questions <- surveys_renamed %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = (starts_with("q")),
               names_to = "question",
               values_to = "response",

Now that the names are manageable and understandable, and the repeated questions regrouped, I'll rearrange the data to make comparable information adjacent.

    filter(is.na(q_goal_constituents) | q_goal_constituents != "test") %>%
    #deal with NAs
    mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(.,"n/a"))) %>%
    mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(.,"N/A"))) %>%

    group_by(sort("UserID")) %>%
