Goals of this HW

Gaining experience with loading data from Excel files and rearranging data into tidy format; reinforce your dplyr and ggplot skills.


We will work with data from the UN World Population Prospects (downloaded here https://population.un.org/wpp/) on the 

 - Total fertility rate (TFR) from "WPP2019_FERT_F04_TOTAL_FERTILITY.xlsx" which informally refers to the average number of children per woman. 
The official interpretation is as follows ``The average number of live births a hypothetical cohort of women would have at the end of their reproductive period if they were subject during their whole lives to the fertility rates of a given period and if they were not subject to mortality. It is expressed as live births per woman.''
 - Sex ratio at birth (SRB) from "WPP2019_FERT_F02_SEX_RATIO_AT_BIRTH.xlsx", the number of male births per 1 female birth.

Relevant info in both data sets is as follows:

 - Our estimates of interest are stored on the sheet ESTIMATES.
 - Rows refer to countries as well as other geographical regions. we will focus on countries only, which are defined as rows with the column Type being Country/Area.
 - Columns indicated by periods, i.e. "2015-2020", include the estimate for that period and area
 - Parent code indicates the geographical region that the country belongs too

 
I use read_excel from readxl package to read the data. 
Detailed instructions are given for the TFR data. You can add your own code to read the SBR data set.

## Reading data
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(rmarkdown)
```

Read the TFR data, using arguments skip and sheet to get the relevant info
```{r}
dat_dontuse <- read_excel("D:/Umass Amherst/BIOSTATS 597D/HW/WPP2019_FERT_F04_TOTAL_FERTILITY.xlsx",
  skip = 16, sheet = "ESTIMATES"
)
```

Note that you can check the data types per column using glimpse
```{r}
glimpse(dat_dontuse)
```

We can see that the TFR estimates for the periods are stored as character strings while we want numeric values. This is due to the usage of "..." for missing values. If you specify this use of "..." for NAs, you see that the TFR values are indeed stored as numeric.
```{r}
dat <- read_excel("D:/Umass Amherst/BIOSTATS 597D/HW/WPP2019_FERT_F04_TOTAL_FERTILITY.xlsx",
  skip = 16, sheet = "ESTIMATES", na = "..."
)
glimpse(dat)
```


For you to do: Read in the SBR data set
```{r}
# read sbr data set
dat_sex <- read_excel("D:/Umass Amherst/BIOSTATS 597D/HW/WPP2019_FERT_F02_SEX_RATIO_AT_BIRTH.xlsx",
  skip = 16, sheet = "ESTIMATES", na = "..."
)
glimpse(dat_sex)
```


## HW exercises: 


## 1. Graph 
Make the graph below which shows TFR estimates against time for 

 - subset of countries in Middle and South Africa (with parent code 911 or 913), 
 
 including those that are either 
 
 - high fertility countries with a TFR $>$ 5 in 2015-2020
 
 OR 
 
 - fast decline countries, here defined as countries with a change greater than 3 over the time period from "1950-1955" to "2015-2020". 

<!--![Example plot for exercise 2.](hw3_fig1.png)-->
```{r}

data_Q1 <- filter(dat, `Parent code` == 911 | `Parent code` == 913, dat[,21] > 5|dat[,8] - dat[,21] > 3) %>% 
  pivot_longer("1950-1955":"2015-2020",names_to = "period", values_to = "tfr")
colnames(data_Q1)[3] = "Country" 
data_Q1 <- data_Q1 %>%   
  group_by(Country)%>%
  # mutate(Category = ifelse(select(period,`2015-2020`) > 5), "high fertility", "fast decline") 
mutate(Category = ifelse(tfr[period =="2015-2020"]>5, "high fertility", "fast decline") ) %>% 
  mutate(year = str_sub(period, start = 1, end = 4)) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year) + 2.5)  
  
ggplot(data = data_Q1, aes(x = year,y = tfr))+
  geom_point(aes(x = year,y = tfr,shape = Category, color = Country))+ 
  geom_line(aes(group = Country, color = Country)) +
  xlab("year") + ylab("tfr") +
  guides(shape = guide_legend(order = 1))
  scale_shape_manual = c(1,2)
```


## 2. Findings for 2015-2020 
For the period 2015-2020, obtain the set of countries (not regions) with SRB $>$ 1.1. For those countries, calculate the "male TFR", which is given by TFR*SRB/(1+SRB). 

To hand in: print a table with male TFR for 2015-2020 for the selected countries with SBR $>$ 1.1. 

```{r}
data_Q2 <- filter(dat_sex,`2015-2020` > 1.1) %>% 
  slice(-c(3))

data_tfr <- filter(dat,dat[3] == "China"|dat[3] == "Armenia"|dat[3] =="Azerbaijan"|dat[3] == "Viet Nam")

data_Q2 <- cbind(data_Q2, data_tfr[21])
colnames(data_Q2)[22] = "tfr"
data_male_tfr <- data_Q2 %>%   
  mutate(male_TFR = tfr*`2015-2020`/(1+`2015-2020`)) %>% 
  select(`Region, subregion, country or area *`,male_TFR)
data_Q2

```
