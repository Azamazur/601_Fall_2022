## Education/Work Background
I majored in Business Administration (Commerce) at Waseda University in Tokyo.
I worked for a marketing research company where I first became interested in analyzing human behavior data!

## R experience
I took a course in Business Analytics using R a few years ago.

## Research interests
Human behavior on digital platform
How people's attitudes toward new ideas change (and how such changes are transmitted)

## Hometown
Tokyo.
I consider Mexico City (where I currently live) as my second hometown!

## Hobbies
Playing the ukulele 

## Fun fact
I like movies and dramas so much that I became a part-time actor (mostly extra though!) because I want to be in movies myself.
