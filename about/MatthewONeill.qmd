## Education/Work Background

Hello!

My name is Matt, I'm in the online CSMS program and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer or potentially Data Scientist. I did my undergraduate degree at UMass as well as a Math major. I was originally planning to be an actuary, but I wasn't a huge fan of the work, so I decided to go back to school to pursue a CS degree, and it was a great decision.

My work background is limited to internships thus far, starting with an Actuarial Science internship at John Hancock during my undergraduate degree, and this year I interned as a Software Engineer at a GPS company called TomTom, and Staples.

## R experience

I have a fair bit of R experience from taking Stat 525, where most of the homeworks were done using R as well as our final project.


## Research interests

For this course, I'd be primarily interested in researching time series data related to the Stock Martket,  inerest rates, or inflation rates. I am also an avid sports fan so I would love to reseach NFL or MLB data.

## Hometown

I am originally from Weymouth, MA

## Hobbies
Playing Chess or Golf, Listening to Music, Fantasy Sports, Exploring Cities and trying restaurants and bars.

## Fun fact

A fun fact about me is that I have 3 Golden Retrievers
