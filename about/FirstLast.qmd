## Education/Work Background
Graduated from Siena College in 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Economics and Information Systems minor

Currently employed at a local branch of a bank. I worked many jobs before the bank, my favorite job was working outside at a golf course. I enjoyed being there and meeting people and then I could go play after work.

## R experience
I learned R in a business statistics class during my sophomore year at Siena. We learned how to upload and analyze data. It took me awhile to figure out R and I also did not understand data analysis right away. Now I am trying to shake the rust off because it has been a few years since I have used R. I think this class will help me understand the full capability of R because I only learned some of the things that it is used for.

## Research interests
I am interested in researching sports statistics because I love sports, but we stayed away from it in my other classes. I think that was because there are a lot of statistics that are unrelated or would be meaningless to try to test for correlation, and we wanted something where we could try to find meaningful correlation. Outside of that, I really am fine with looking at any data to try to find things.
