## Education/Work Background

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Sociology from Clark University, as well as my Master of Public Administration. I have been working full time at UMass Chan Medical School as a research coordinator for 1.5 years on projects centered around improving education and employment access and outcomes for young adults with mental health conditions.

## R experience

I have absolutely 0 experience with R, and almost non-existent coding experience in general.

## Research interests

I'm interested in community-engaged public health research as well as research focusing on mental health, trauma, social policy, and health equity for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals.

## Hometown

Northampton, MA

## Hobbies

In my limited free time I like to do puzzles, read, volunteer for a nonprofit that supports youth, and try to befriend dogs.

## Fun fact

In undergrad I withdrew from Computer Science 101 on the first day of class because I couldn't download Alice to my computer.
