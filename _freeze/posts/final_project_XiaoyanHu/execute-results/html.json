Meat and seafood analogs should mimic the desirable appearance, texture, and flavor of the real versions. In this study, we investigated on the texture of animal meat analogs, expecially on their texture profile of adipose tissue(know as fat meat). \n  \n  In this data, I have 5 samples. Control is beef fat.Sample 1-4 composed of different plant-based ingredients such as soybean oil, coconut oil, soybean protein and agar to combine them into a emulsion or gel that looks similar as fat meat under microscope. However, they still have huge differences on the macro texture. \n  \n  Texture profile anaylsis mimics motion and force in human oral cavity. the measurement including two times of compression and raw data including time and corresponding time. From this data set, many other parameters can be calculated from the graph. The automatic calculation sometimes can be confusing and messy data have to be processed by excels and individual calculations.  \n  \n  Parameter including hardness, adhersiveness, resilience, cohesion and chewiness. The defenition and calculation will be introduced in below section. \n\n  In this report, the raw data of texture profile analysis will be tidied and calculated.  The 5 parameter data will be calculated either from raw data or graph and will be visualized. Interpret of comparison in different samples will be performed. Using R may provide an efficient way to process the raw data with better visualization compare to traditional excel plotting and calculation. \n\n## Data \n  Raw TPA data is presented as time versus force. By plotting this graph, further texture parameters can be done by calculation. \n\n### tidy data\n\nIn this section, the raw data was reded in, pivoted and transformed into a new table as previewed below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#read in data.\n# data1 = Texture Profile analysis of 5 samples including data of each time and force\n# the cell_limits c=(upper left cell), c=(lower right cell)\ndata1<- read_excel(\"/Users/cassie199/Desktop/22fall/DACSS601/601_Fall_2022/posts/_data/final_data.xlsx\",\n                   sheet=\"TPAraw\",\n                  range = cell_limits(c(3,1),c(NA,10)),\n              col_names = c(\"control0time\",\"control0force\",\"S10time\",\"S10force\",\"S20time\",\"S20force\",\"S30time\",\"S30force\",\"S40time\",\"S40force\"))\n\n#generate a row number which will help locate data below\ndata1<-mutate(data1, row_num = seq.int(nrow(data1)))\n                               \n#converting character data into numeric\ninvisible(lapply(data1, as.numeric))\n\n#pivot data into 4 variables\ndata2<-data1%>% pivot_longer(cols = c(control0force,S10force, S20force, S30force,S40force),\n                             names_to = \"sampleforce\",\n                             values_to = \"force1\")%>%\n  separate(sampleforce, into = c(\"sample\", \"type\"), sep = \"0\")\n\n#extract columns needed and form a clean data frame\nTDdata<- data.frame(time = data2$control0time,\n                    force1 = data2$force1,\n                    sample = data2$sample,\n                    row_num = data2$row_num)\n#preview of tidy data\nhead(TDdata)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   time force1  sample row_num\n1 0.000   -0.1 control       1\n2 0.000   -1.0      S1       1\n3 0.000   -1.2      S2       1\n4 0.000    1.0      S3       1\n5 0.000    0.7      S4       1\n6 0.005   -5.1 control       2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#result_df = TDdata%>%\n # group_by(sample)%>%\n # arrange(time + sample)%>%\n # mutate(force_T1 = lead(force1))%>%\n  \n#filter(force1>0)%>%\n #filter(force_T1 <0)%>%print()\n#df_1 = result_df %>% filter(sample == \"control\")\n#df_2 = result_df %>% filter(sample == \"S1\")\n#df_3 = result_df %>% filter(sample == \"S2\")\n#df_4 = result_df %>% filter(sample == \"S3\")\n#df_5 = result_df %>% filter(sample == \"S4\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Calculation -\n\n  Below is a sample graph of how raw data plotted out as time VS force looks like.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# In this section, other parameter described above will be calculated\n# Below includes a sample graph\ninclude_graphics(\"/Users/cassie199/Desktop/22fall/DACSS601/601_Fall_2022/posts/—_data/TPA1.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in include_graphics(\"/Users/cassie199/Desktop/22fall/DACSS601/601_Fall_2022/posts/—_data/TPA1.png\"): Cannot find the file(s): \"../../../posts/—_data/TPA1.png\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n  In the texture profile analysis, the highest point of first peak represents the hardness of the sample.The F1 force is defined as hardness of sample.

This indicates the solid fat contributes more to the fat structure instead of the gelling agent (S3,S4 is overall better than S1,S2). Also looking at S1 and S2, gelling agent provide much improvement  while did not work in S3 and S4. The solid oil somehow restricted the impovement of gelling agent.

I want to chose this data because the machine can calculate the value, however sometime with mistakes. In this case, we have to import the data into excel, plot it, find value we need among thousands of data point and then calculate. This process is boring and redunant. By learning r, I found it might be a food idea that I can find a easier way to calculated all this value automatically to avoid human labor. And by the time this programming works, the future data can be imported, organized and visualized automatically which can save much time. Therefore, I decided to work on this project. \n\n###Difficultes I met\nBy looking at others projects and examples in the class, I found most of them are aiming at visualization and analysis. However, in my case, the most heavy work was in calculation. The raw data was simple and easy to tidy, however, finding the significant values in this data requires a lot of work. The measurements were human tested samples and there are many interference data points. For example, I want to find the end point of the first peak, where force = 0. However, how would I select the point since the nears point to 0 may be 10, and the next wil be -10, where 0 doesn't actually have a physically point. In this case, I have to using functions to filter and understand where the value I want exactly and not taking in those interference points. \n\nAlso, reducing the redundant steps has also been a difficulty for me to solve. By learning functions, I found that repeated steps can be easily \n\n  Another thing I have learnt from this class and this project is how to brainstorm the steps that you reach to your final goals. My data looks like a simple data set but considering the interference, it became very difficult to make it accurate. More and more steps were added when i wrote the code and repeat and reduced. So there are tons of effort which may not been present in the code. The learning process was really interesting but tiring, with understanding varies packages and functions. The accumulation will make the future coding much more easier. \n  \n###Next step of this project\n\nI haven't optimized the calculation into a best, easiest and shortest steps to calculate all the values which can be done in the future. Another problem I left was indexing of table into tables. This\n\nAlso, there might be a way to cooperate the sample ingredients into data presenting. However, most of my work was done in descriptions. It may also be difficult to visualize or make those numeric to consider about the ingredients.This could also be innovative in presenting scentific research results to help other understand. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this project calculated the value of texture analysis profile and visualized the data to compare the samples. This helps us to understant the single parameter and overall strenght and weakness of each sample and find the most close lab-made sample to our control. \n\nIn terms of R, this project help me helps me build up idea of how to approach data in a desired manner and how to make the coding easy and simple. Althought I haven't make it perfect in this project, it is a really great process to learn the idea with processing data. \n\n## Bibliography\n1) Hu, X. and D. J.
