Then you can read in the data, using either one of the `readr` standard tidy read commands, or a specialized package such as `readxl`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\nrailroads <- read_csv(\"posts/_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: 'posts/_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv' does not exist in current working directory ('C:/Users/srika/OneDrive/Desktop/DACSS/601_Fall_2022/posts').\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Describe the data\n\n\nBelow you can see the variables are the county's and states, and each case is the number of employees at each railroad station. This data was likely collected at each station and submitted to a state or federal database. It is likely this information was gathered by station, given the data is grouped by state and then by county.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrailroads %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"state\", values_from = \"total_employees\")%>%\n  view()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in pivot_wider(., names_from = \"state\", values_from = \"total_employees\"): object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
